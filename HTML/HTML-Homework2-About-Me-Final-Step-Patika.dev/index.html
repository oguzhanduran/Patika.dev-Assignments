<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
    A passionate developer who genuinely loves every minute of it!
    <br> <br>

    I am familiar with software languages and algorithmic logic as I took some lessons such as C, Pascal, PLC and Automation while at university. In addition to this, my short-term goal is to learn new languages (HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript) ​​and their libraries (Bootstrap, React) to develop user-friendly and interactive interfaces.
    <br> <br>
    I graduated from Kocaeli University after studying electrical engineering, and after serving in the military as an electrical engineer, I realized something. At the end of all the roads leading to my dreams, I was faced by the English language barrier so I decided to eliminate this problem. I have brought my English level from next-to-nothing to an upper-intermediate level in just 1.5 years by working hard for around 12 hours a day independently. As a result, I managed to achieve a band score of 5.5 from the IELTS General Training.
    <br> <br>
    During this difficult process, I was studying English during the day and at night I was researching where to take the next step in my career. After a strenuous research process, I realized that I have a strong interest in front-end web development. Although I did not want to change my career at first, my irresistible desire and enthusiasm pushed me to change my career. At the end of this process, I decided to do what I love, and as of July 2021, I started to study front-end development.
    <br> <br>
    If you want to work with someone who is new to this sector but passionate & driven, I would be honored to meet with you.

        The Pursuit of Happyness is a 2006 American biographical drama film directed by Gabriele Muccino and starring Will Smith as Chris Gardner, a homeless salesman. Smith's son Jaden Smith co-stars, making his film debut as Gardner's son, Christopher Jr. The screenplay by Steven Conrad is based on the best-selling 2006 memoir of the same name written by Gardner with Quincy Troupe. It is based on Gardner's nearly one-year struggle being homeless.[2] The unusual spelling of the film's title comes from a mural that Gardner sees on the wall outside the daycare facility his son attended.
